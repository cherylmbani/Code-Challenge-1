Code Challenge 1 

Welcome to my **Code Challenge 1** repository! This is where I tackled Week 1 JavaScript problems, inspired by real-life Kenyan experiences — from brewing the perfect cup of chai, budgeting boda boda rides, to estimating mobile money transaction fees.

## 💡 What's Inside

### 1. **Chai Bora Ingredient Calculator** ☕  
A simple calculator that determines how many cups of Kenyan-style chai you can make based on available ingredients: tea leaves, milk, water, and sugar.  
> Because chai isn’t just a drink — it’s a *ritual*.

📁 File: `chaiCalculator/chai.js`

### 2. **Boda Boda Ride Fare Estimator** 🛵  
A quick tool that helps you estimate how much your next boda boda ride might cost, based on a base fare, distance, and time.  
> No surprises, just safe budgeting.

📁 File: `bodaFare/boda.js`

### 3. **Mobile Money Transaction Fee Estimator** 📱  
Calculates transaction fees for sending money via mobile money platforms. Works using tiered logic with set minimums and maximums for fairness and transparency.  
> Know your fees *before* you send.

📁 File: `transactionFee/fee.js`
